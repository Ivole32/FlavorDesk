I’ve started working on a UI using Flutter. Since I’m not familiar with the required programming languages and frameworks yet, I have to learn and build everything from scratch.

As a first step, I managed to get a simple **Hello World** application running. It’s a small start, but an important milestone before moving on to more complex UI elements.
