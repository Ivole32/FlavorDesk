#### 🛠️ Development Log – API Token Storage

I am currently working on implementing **secure API token storage** for the application.  
The intention is to handle user authentication data in a **safe and cross-platform compliant way**, following best practices.

At this stage, the implementation is **still in progress**. While the logic and structure are being developed, there are currently **platform-specific build issues on Windows** related to native dependencies of the secure storage solution. These issues are being investigated and resolved as part of the development process.

This reflects the current state of development for the competition submission.
