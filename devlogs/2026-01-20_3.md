#### 🛠️ Development Log – Frontpage Projects, Settings & Release Prep

In the last few hours I focused on improving both the **usability** and the **overall structure** of the application.

Projects are now successfully **loaded and displayed on the start page**, allowing users to immediately see their available projects after launching the app. At the current stage, these project entries are intentionally **read-only**. While users cannot yet modify project data, they can already interact with the most important external resources by opening links to the **demo**, **README**, and **GitHub repository** directly from the UI. This lays the foundation for future project management features while keeping the current implementation stable and predictable.

I also implemented a **settings page** to give users more control over their experience. From there, users can:
- Update or replace their **API key** without restarting the app
- Toggle between **light mode and dark mode**, with the UI responding instantly

To further improve the app’s presentation, I added a **custom application icon**, helping the project feel more complete and recognizable as a real desktop application rather than a prototype.

With these pieces now in place, the next focus is on **distribution and release preparation**. I plan to create a proper release build soon, including a Windows **.exe**, and publish it as a real release rather than a development-only build. This will mark an important milestone in moving the project from active development toward a usable, shareable application.
